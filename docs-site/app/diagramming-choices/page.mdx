# Diagramming Choices

Ameliorate's structure hopefully makes it easier to diagram many situations, but sometimes there are situations where it isn't straightforward how to diagram them. Sometimes you have multiple ways of representing the same information, and it's not easy to tell which way is best. This page describes some of these situations, and possible ways to go about them.

Some situations may also be hard to represent because Ameliorate's [ontology](https://ameliorate.app/keyserj/ameliorate-ontology) does not have the node types to represent the information.

If you have any ideas on potentially-better ways to represent these situations, or you have a situation that you're not sure how to represent, please [reach out](https://github.com/amelioro/ameliorate/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#reaching-out)!

## Known tough-to-diagram situations

### Multiple variations for one solution

Sometimes a solution can be implemented in different ways, and representing that can be challenging. For example, in the [failing-trade-route](https://ameliorate.app/keyserj/failing-trade-route?view=Bandits) topic, one way to deal with bandits is to Bait & Ambush them, but such a thing can be done many ways! Perhaps this could be accomplished using a local militia, or by hiring guards, or by training villagers to help, or some combination of these. We could even discuss hiring 20 guards vs hiring 40 guards vs hiring another number of guards - when you can make variations by just changing numbers, there are an infinite number of possibilities!

If it seems reasonable to discuss these possibilities without going into detailed tradeoffs, the simplest thing is to just represent each variable as a solution component, like [this](https://ameliorate.app/keyserj/failing-trade-route?view=Decoy+and+Ambush). The solution might not actually use all of these components, but they at least exist in the diagram for discussion.

If there are multiple variables that can be adjusted for a solution, and you want to consider multiple variations across each of those variables, then you can create a problem for each variable, with a solution for each variation. For example, a problem "ambushing bandits with whom" could have solutions that each convey a different set of people to use for the ambush. See [this example](https://ameliorate.app/keyserj/failing-trade-route-after?view=Variants+-+problem+per+variable).

If you don't care to consider each variable individually, but you still want to discuss the best variation, then you can make a problem like "best way to ambush bandits", with solutions for each set of ways to do the ambush - see [this example](https://ameliorate.app/keyserj/failing-trade-route-after?view=Variants+-+problem+to+choose+variant).

If there are only a couple variations you care to consider, you could treat each as a distinct solution to the original problem. See [this example](https://ameliorate.app/keyserj/failing-trade-route-after?view=Variants+-+solution+for+each+variant).

<Callout type="info">
  Some ideas for changing Ameliorate's structure to improve this, but that haven't been thoroughly
  considered: add an Option node type; allow any node type to be an option for another related node;
  add variables with discrete possible values as a new kind of information that any node can have.

### Cycles / Circular dependencies

Sometimes two nodes cause each other, e.g. A causes B and B also causes A. This is a bit awkward to model in Ameliorate, because of the following limitations that currently exist:

1. nodes are laid out such that relations always flow in the same direction (i.e. bottom-to-top) (to keep flow consistent and easy-to-see)
2. nodes cannot have multiple edges between each other (this was an assumption originally for saving coding effort)

The [diagram-choices-cycles](https://ameliorate.app/keyserj/diagram-choices-cycles) topic shows some ways to model this situation:

1. [Indirect cycle](https://ameliorate.app/keyserj/diagram-choices-cycles?view=Indirect+cycle): create an intermediate node X such that A causes B, B causes X, then X can cause A. This is probably the most intuitive, but only works if the cycle is indirect, and one of the edges will look a bit awkward as it rotates around.
2. [Opposite edge label](https://ameliorate.app/keyserj/diagram-choices-cycles?view=Opposite+edge+label): use an opposite edge label, e.g. A causes B, and A is caused by B. This is a bit awkward because the edges both point the same directions but they mean opposite things.
3. [Duplicate one node](https://ameliorate.app/keyserj/diagram-choices-cycles?view=Duplicate+one+node): create a second node A2 with the same text as A, such that such that A causes B, and B causes A2. This creates an awkward duplication, and A2 doesn't automatically have all the details that A has (even though it should), but it allows both relations to be considered.
