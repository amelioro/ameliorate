/*
  The `important` flag adds !important to all Tailwind utilities.
  
  This is needed because Tailwind v4 outputs styles in CSS cascade layers (@layer),
  and layered styles always lose to unlayered styles regardless of specificity.
  MUI v5's Emotion-based styles are unlayered, so without `important`, MUI styles
  would always override Tailwind utilities.
  
  If MUI is upgraded to v6+, this can be replaced with the cleaner CSS layer approach:

  JS Tailwind config is considered legacy in favor of Tailwind v4's CSS-first @theme approach, but
  we need to use JS in order to add our custom MUI palette to Tailwind. See file comment in

  If we ever want to remove these styles, we need to add an explicit border
  color utility to any element that depends on these defaults.
