Thesis:\nThe VISIBLE Act mandates immigration enforcement officers to wear visible identification during public-facing operations. This is to promote transparency and accountability, ensuring the public can easily identify officers during enforcement activities under the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n\n  1.1. Con:\n  Could potentially endanger officers if their identities are easily accessible in hostile environments.\n\n  1.2. Con:\n  May impose additional procedural burdens on officers during urgent enforcement actions, impacting response times.\n\n  1.3. Con:\n  Could interfere with covert operations where officer anonymity is strategically necessary.\n\n  1.4. Pro:\n  This bill also prohibits the use of non-medical face coverings like masks or balaclavas that obscure identity or facial visibility, with exceptions for environmental hazards or covert operations.\n\n  1.5. Pro:\n  Promotes transparency and accountability by ensuring officers are visibly identifiable during enforcement actions.\n\n  1.6. Pro:\n  Increases public trust by allowing individuals to verify the identity of immigration officers in public-facing interactions.\n\n  1.7. Pro:\n  Encourages proper conduct among officers as they are more accountable when their identities are visible.\n</kialoArguments>\n",
