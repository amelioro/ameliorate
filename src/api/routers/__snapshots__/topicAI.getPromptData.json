                "description": "Implies the intended meaning of the node. There are three categories of node types: Breakdown, Research, and Justification.  Generally if a node could be a breakdown node or another category of node, it should be a breakdown node, because those are generally causally-related nodes, and causally-related things are easier to reason about.\n\nBreakdown nodes are the primary focus of a diagram, and usually causally-relate to each other.\n\nBreakdown node types:\n- Problem: core problem that wants to be solved, e.g. \"cars going too fast in my neighborhood\"\n- Cause: matters mainly because it causes a Problem, e.g. \"street goes downhill\"\n- Detriment: if caused by a Problem, explains why a Problem is concerning; if caused by a Solution, explains a downside of a Solution; e.g. \"pedestrians might get hit\"\n- Benefit: positive effect, e.g. \"people get places faster\"\n- Effect: neutral effect; use this if an effect isn't obviously positive or negative, e.g. \"fewer larger wildlife in neighborhood\"\n- Solution: option for addressing a Problem, or one of its Causes/Detriments, e.g. \"speed bump between intersection and hill\"\n- Solution Component: piece of a Solution, e.g. \"rubber, portable speed bump\", \"$500 cost\"\n- Obstacle: impedes a Solution, e.g. \"street is a thoroughfare\"\n- Mitigation: option for addressing a downside of a Solution, e.g. \"only place speedbump on downhill-going half of street\"\n- Mitigation Component: piece of a Mitigation, if the Mitigation is worth detailing\n- Criterion: indicates a good aspect of a Solution and can be used to compare Solutions, e.g. \"inexpensive\"; this isn't causally-related to other breakdown nodes, and so doesn't necessarily belong in this category, but it's here for now.\n\nResearch nodes are auxiliary nodes that provide context about unknowns to look into, relevant facts, etc. These generally relate to a specific node or nodes.\n\nResearch node types:\n- Question: an unknown that would be good to clarify or find an answer for, usually asks about another node, e.g. \"what traffic data is available?\"\n- Answer: potential answer to a question\n- Fact: auxiliary detail, usually a statistic, e.g. \"residential street has 25 mph speed limit\"\n- Source: source of some information, could be an article or website; these node's text should generally be a title, and the node's notes should be the URL; e.g. \"WI traffic manual\"\n\nJustification nodes are auxiliary nodes that convey arguments in support or critique of the implication of a node or edge in the topic. Node implications are \"[node text] is an important [node type] in the context of this topic\", and edge implications are \"[source node text] [edge type, verb] [target node text]\".\n\nJustification node types:\n- Root Claim: a claim about the impliciation of a node or edge, e.g. \"'cars going too fast in my neighborhood' is an important Problem in the context of this topic\"\n- Support: a claim that supports another claim, e.g. \"visually see cars zipping by all the time\"\n- Critique: a claim that critiques another claim, e.g. \"we measured traffic years ago, and it wasn't a problem\".\n\nFinally, there's the Custom node, which can be used when there's some information that doesn't fit cleanly into another existing node type."

Thesis:\nThe VISIBLE Act mandates immigration enforcement officers to wear visible identification during public-facing operations. This is to promote transparency and accountability, ensuring the public can easily identify officers during enforcement activities under the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n\n  1.1. Con:\n  Could potentially endanger officers if their identities are easily accessible in hostile environments.\n\n  1.2. Con:\n  May impose additional procedural burdens on officers during urgent enforcement actions, impacting response times.\n\n  1.3. Con:\n  Could interfere with covert operations where officer anonymity is strategically necessary.\n\n  1.4. Pro:\n  This bill also prohibits the use of non-medical face coverings like masks or balaclavas that obscure identity or facial visibility, with exceptions for environmental hazards or covert operations.\n\n  1.5. Pro:\n  Promotes transparency and accountability by ensuring officers are visibly identifiable during enforcement actions.\n\n  1.6. Pro:\n  Increases public trust by allowing individuals to verify the identity of immigration officers in public-facing interactions.\n\n  1.7. Pro:\n  Encourages proper conduct among officers as they are more accountable when their identities are visible.\n</kialoArguments>\n",
