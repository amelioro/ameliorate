# Design Document

## Introduction

[Provide a high-level overview of the implementation strategy for the feature.]

## Alternatives

[A bullet point list of any alternative implementation approaches that were considered and why they were not chosen. This helps to provide context and rationale for the chosen approach.]

- **ALT-001**: [title] - rejected because [reason(s)].
- **ALT-002**: [title] - rejected because [reason(s)].

## Relevant Existing Code

[Provide a high-level overview of the existing areas of the codebase that may be affected and need to change.]
[Include mermaid diagrams if relevant.]

### Files

[A list of files that are affected and may need to be changed.]

- **FILE-001 [file path 1]**: [description of expected relevance and impact]
- **FILE-002 [file path 2]**: [description of expected relevance and impact]

### Dependencies

[List any dependencies that will be relevant for implementation, such as libraries, frameworks, or other components that the plan relies on.]

- **DEP-001 [dependency title 1]**: [description of relevance. provide links to relevant external documentation if necessary.]
- **DEP-002 [dependency title 2]**: [description of relevance. provide links to relevant external documentation if necessary.]

## Implementation concerns

[List concerns with implementing the feature, and any assumptions being made. Consider issues of integrating with existing code.]

- **RISK-001**: [description of risk]
- **ASSUMPTION-001**: [description of assumption]

## Testing strategy

[List tests that can be updated or implemented to reduce risks and increase confidence in the correctness of the implementation.]

- **TEST-001**: [description of test]
- **TEST-002**: [description of test]

## Implementation Steps

[Break down the needed work into implementation phases. Each implementation phase should include a set of related tasks that accomplish a common goal. Ideally these can be implemented and tested independently from each other. All implementation phases together should add up to accomplish all of the requirements.]

### Phase 1

- GOAL-001: [Describe the goal of this phase, e.g., "Implement feature X", "Refactor module Y", etc.]

| Task     | Description           | Completed | Date       |
| -------- | --------------------- | --------- | ---------- |
| TASK-001 | Description of task 1 | âœ…        | 2025-04-25 |
| TASK-002 | Description of task 2 |           |            |
| TASK-003 | Description of task 3 |           |            |

#### Files to update

[List the files that need to be updated during this phase.]

- **FILE-XXX [file path 1]**: [description of what needs to change]
- **FILE-XXX [file path 2]**: [description of what needs to change]

#### Relevant pseudo-code or algorithms [optional]

[If any method-level changes are expected to be complicated, use this section to flesh them out.]

##### [title describing designed method-level changes]

[method-level design]

### Phase 2

- GOAL-002: [Describe the goal of this phase, e.g., "Implement feature X", "Refactor module Y", etc.]

| Task     | Description           | Completed | Date |
| -------- | --------------------- | --------- | ---- |
| TASK-004 | Description of task 4 |           |      |
| TASK-005 | Description of task 5 |           |      |
| TASK-006 | Description of task 6 |           |      |

#### Files to update

[List the files that need to be updated during this phase.]
